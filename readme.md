# Mosque screens donations

A donation platform for mosque screens. This project is part of the "Help make Mosque Screens free" campaign

## Help make Mosque Screens sustainable 

The Mosque Screens project is a self funded project and does not have any financial income. As with all tech projects, there are costs which are incurred by the maintainers. These include: Servers, domains, databases etc.

You can donate as little or as much as you want, there is no obligation. Each penny will be used to pay for the running of these screens and keep it free for mosques around the world.
